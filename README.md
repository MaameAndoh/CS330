## Introduction
My name is Maame Andoh, and I'm currently a Computer Science student at Simmons University. This is a project I created for the Structures and Organization of Programming Languages course. 

This course included a Programming Language Project (PLP) where we learned a programming language of our choice and created tutorials explaining the conventions and concepts in the language. The language I chose was C++. 

Each tutorial covers a different area of C++, and I've also included code you can download and run to better understand how C++ works, and get started with the language.

Happy Programming!
